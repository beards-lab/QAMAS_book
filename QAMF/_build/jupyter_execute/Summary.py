# # Summary and conclusions 
# 
# The collection of calculations and simulations presented here represents a framework for analyzing and simulating mitochondrial function using basic thermodynamic and kinetic principles. This framework largely uses simple mass-action representations of kinetic processes, rather than models accounting for detailed catalytic mechanisms. It is perhaps remarkable that this simple approach is able effectively capture the systems-level function of ATP synthesis and respiratory control both in vitro and in vivo. Since these models and simulations are grounded in a rigorous treatment of the thermodynamics, we conclude that---with respect to the phenomena addressed in the simulations presented here---the thermodynamics of many of the underlying chemical processes is more important than the kinetics. However, in contrast to that general conclusion, the adenine nucleotide translocase, in particular,  is represented with a model to account for the kinetics of its catalytic mechanism. Since the adenine nucleotide translocase catalyzes the final step in oxidative ATP synthesis, its kinetic mechanism is predicted to have the most direct influence of all the steps in governing cellular energetics and respiratory control in vivo. Moreover, the conclusion, for example, that the kinetics of complex I is effectively represented by the simple mass-action model of Equation {eq}`eq:complexI`, is dependent on context. While the model works for the purposes used here, it does not provide insights into phenomena that depend on a more detailed representation of the enzyme mechanism, as may be investigated using more complex models {cite}`Bazil2016`.

# *Dan - do we want to comment on the normal vs. heart failure cases in this summary part as well?* 
# 
# By embedding all of the computer codes for the calculations and simulations that we have presented, our intention is to facilitate an easy adoption and modification of the concepts developed here. Armed with these concepts and codes, it is hoped that readers will reuse, repurpose, update, modify, test, and extend these models. Moreover, we hope that users and developers of these concepts will adopt publication vehicles such as this one, for sharing data, codes, and associated calculations with the community.
